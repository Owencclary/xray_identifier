    'Avulsion fracture': 'This occurs when a fragment of bone is pulled away by a tendon or ligament. It typically happens due to a strong muscle contraction or force applied to the bone',
    'Comminuted fracture':'A comminuted fracture involves the bone breaking into several pieces. This type of fracture is usually caused by severe trauma, such as a car accident.',
    'Fracture Dislocation': 'This is a combination of a fracture and a dislocation, where the bone is not only broken but also displaced from its joint.',
    'Greenstick fracture': 'Commonly seen in children, a greenstick fracture occurs when the bone bends and cracks, but does not break completely. It is similar to how a green twig breaks.',
    'Hairline Fracture': 'Also known as a stress fracture, a hairline fracture is a small, thin crack in the bone. It often occurs due to repetitive stress or overuse.',
    'Impacted fracture': 'This type of fracture happens when the broken ends of the bone are driven into each other. It can occur due to falls or accidents where a strong force compresses the bone.',
    'Longitudinal fracture': 'A longitudinal fracture runs along the length of the bone. It can be caused by direct or indirect force.',
    'Oblique fracture': 'An oblique fracture is characterized by an angled break across the bone. It is often caused by a sharp blow or indirect force applied at an angle.',
    'Pathological fracture': 'This type of fracture occurs in bones weakened by disease, such as osteoporosis, cancer, or infection. The bone can break with minimal or no trauma.',
    'Spiral Fracture': 'A spiral fracture occurs when a rotating force is applied along the axis of the bone. It results in a helical break and is commonly seen in twisting injuries.',
    'non_fractured': 'No fracture detected.'
